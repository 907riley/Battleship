# Battleship
My CPSC121 battleship game that I spent too much time on as a freshman.

Clone the repo and run the command `make all` to run the program on linux.

Alternatively, you can run `docker compose run battleship /bin/bash` to build, run and attach the container to your shell. From there you can run `battleship` anywhere to play the game.
